      <title>Weight of abstraction</title>

      <description>What drives abstraction? The laws of physics of abstractions. software is a mechanics of abstractions, so we should understand the physics of it.  Cost vs weight Cost considers lots of things -- perf, maintainability, compile-time, specific to programming.</description>

      <title>Histools: visualizing my browser history over time with Ink and Torus</title>

      <description>Today I made Histools, a small set of tools for visualizing browser history data from Apple&amp;rsquo;s Safari browser. It renders a heatmap of pages visited on Safari over time, alongside a searchable, sorted list of pages I&amp;rsquo;ve visited most often with mini-heatmaps for each URL.</description>

      <title>Schrift: a faster, bytecode-driven interpreter for Ink</title>
      <link>https://dotink.co/posts/schrift-code/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a new big project recently: a faster, better-designed, more versatile interpreter for Ink, rewritten from the ground-up, called Schrift.
Schrift is an experimental runtime for Ink focused on performance and runtime instrumentation capabilities, and is still very much under development.</description>

      <title>System calls from the Go runtime in the Minimum Viable Go Program</title>
      <link>https://dotink.co/posts/go-syscalls/</link>

      <guid>https://dotink.co/posts/go-syscalls/</guid>
      <description>Go, despite being a fully compiled language, has a sizeable runtime that helps Go programs handle things like multithreading, input/output, global variable initialization, and memory safety. To provide all of these convenience and safety features, the Go runtime interacts with the operating system in ways that are often opaque to the Go code we write.</description>

      <title>Ink language support in Visual Studio Code</title>

      <guid>https://dotink.co/posts/ink-vscode/</guid>
      <description>Today, I published the first version of ink-vscode, which adds support for the Ink language to the Visual Studio Code editor.
So far, there has only been one kind of editor support for the Ink language, in the form of a syntax definition for the Vim editor.</description>

      <title>Syntax highlighting Ink programs with the September toolchain</title>
      <link>https://dotink.co/posts/syntax-highlight/</link>

      <guid>https://dotink.co/posts/syntax-highlight/</guid>
      <description>Although Ink is over a year old now, it has never had a dedicated syntax highlighter. When I write Ink programs, which is the vast majority of my time reading Ink code, I&amp;rsquo;ve used a vim syntax file to take advantage of vim&amp;rsquo;s syntax highlighting capabilities.</description>

      <title>The September compiler: translating Ink to JavaScript</title>

      <guid>https://dotink.co/posts/september/</guid>
      <description>September is an Ink to JavaScript compiler, written in Ink itself. It&amp;rsquo;s so-called because it&amp;rsquo;s the first in a forthcoming series of autumn-month-themed tools written in and for Ink:
 September, a compiler to JavaScript, which is what this post is about August, an assembler and linker, which is yet to be started October, a symbolic mathematics environment, which is even more yet to be started, but which I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about  Autumn months are great, especially because august is the best song on folklore which is a lyrical and aural masterpiece by the queen of pop Taylor Swift herself, but that&amp;rsquo;s for me to go on about on a different website.</description>

      <description>Good software engineering is concerned with two kinds of scale: operational scale and engineering scale.
Operational scale measures how many processors and compute nodes are in your production infrastructure, and how many requests and responses the system handles every second.</description>

      <title>A discussion on NLP, GPT-3, and language models</title>

      <description>Preface Last Saturday, I hosted a small casual hangout discussing recent developments in NLP, focusing on OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s new GPT-3 language model. Not being in the machine learning field, I wanted to understand what the excitement was about, and what these new language models enabled us to build.</description>

      <title>Better terminal output from Ink with ANSI escape codes</title>
      <link>https://dotink.co/posts/ansi/</link>

      <description>ANSI escape codes Most of the time, we think of a computer terminal as a place to output text. We generate logs and print output from programs to the terminal, and interact with the shell by typing lines in and getting lines out.</description>

      <title>Binary search for rational approximations of irrational numbers</title>
      <link>https://dotink.co/posts/rational-binary-search/</link>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s a reasonably simple rational approximation of Pi?
We might take a naive approach and simply take a fraction like \(\frac{314159265}{100000000}\) and reduce it to get a fractional representation of an arbitrary decimal form of Pi. But this is boring, and requires large denominators to be precise.</description>

      <title>Notable papers about computing and software</title>

      <description>This year, I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending more time reading papers about computer science and software engineering. I&amp;rsquo;m not in academia, so I don&amp;rsquo;t always read papers in the cutting edge of the field, but I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed reading seminal papers written at the birth of interesting technologies.</description>

      <title>Traceur: a path tracing renderer in Ink and JavaScript</title>
      <link>https://dotink.co/posts/traceur/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2020 10:12:27 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dotink.co/posts/traceur/</guid>
      <description>Traceur (pronounced like trace + connoisseur) is a path tracing renderer written in Ink. Traceur is capable of rendering scenes with spherical objects, realistic shadows, reflections, refractions, and depth of field. Internally, Traceur uses well-defined interfaces for working with shapes, materials, and scene descriptions, so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to extend with new textures and lighting effects.</description>

      <title>inkfmt: a self-hosting code formatter for Ink</title>

      <description>inkfmt (pronounced &amp;ldquo;ink format&amp;rdquo; or sometimes &amp;ldquo;ink fuh-mt&amp;rdquo;) is a self-hosting code formatter for the Ink language. This means inkfmt takes valid Ink programs and normalizes the formatting of the code to be readable and clean. inkfmt is itself an Ink program, and inkfmt uses itself to format its own source code.</description>

      <title>How I set up my servers</title>

      <description>Many of my projects include a web server, usually written in Go, Node.js, or Ink. I deploy these servers to Linux VMs running on DigitalOcean, and I set them all up very similarly. I currently have 17 separate web servers / projects running across two $5/month servers.</description>

      <description>While researching the difference between Intel&amp;rsquo;s various x86 SIMD extensions, I came across this article that demonstrates SSE and AVX performance differences using an algorithm to compute an approximation of pi using a Riemann sum under a curve.</description>

      <title>Visualizing and exploring sorting algorithms in two dimensions with Ink</title>

      <description>Until Elon Musk brings his Neuralink gadgets to market, our eyes are the highest-bandwidth way we have of understanding the world around us. We can look at something and immediately take in the hues, the lightness and the darkness, the shapes, and most importantly, the patterns that we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to notice if we couldn&amp;rsquo;t use our vision.</description>

This post started out as a long-form response to this tweet by Raj Kunkolienkar:
Question to all the side project machines that I follow (with much respect) : what framework / setup / infrastructure / tools do you use to push out ideas to MVP so quickly?</description>
