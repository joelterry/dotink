## Projects

### Traceur

Traceur is a path-tracing renderer in Ink, supporting Monte-Carlo antialiasing, realistic shadows, reflections, refractions, and focus blur. I wrote about [building Traceur here](/posts/traceur/).

### Matisse

Matisse is a minimalistic gallery of generative art pieces that are written in Ink. As a web app, Matisse depends on the September compiler to compile Ink programs and algorithms down to JavaScript.

## Language tooling

### September

September is an Ink to JavaScript compiler, written in Ink itself and tested against Ink's standard library tests. September aims to become self-hosting, but is not there yet. I wrote about [building September here](/posts/september/).
