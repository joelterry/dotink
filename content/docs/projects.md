## Projects

### Traceur

Traceur is a path-tracing renderer in Ink, supporting Monte-Carlo antialiasing, realistic shadows, reflections, refractions, and focus blur. I wrote about [building Traceur here](/posts/traceur/).

<a href="https://github.com/thesephist/traceur" class="button">See on GitHub &rarr;</a>

### Matisse

Matisse is a minimalistic gallery of generative art pieces that are written in Ink. As a web app, Matisse depends on the September compiler to compile Ink programs and algorithms down to JavaScript.

### Polyx

Polyx is Linus's personal productivity suite.

### Klisp

Klisp is a very minimal LISP written in Ink. It's primarily a pedagogical project -- I made it to understand Lisp better. Ink's semantics are already quite Lispy, so Klisp builds on Ink's semantics and adds an S-expression grammar and a repl, a true read-eval-print loop, for an ergonomic Lisp experience.

### Histools analyzer

Histools is a collection of tools for generating heatmaps and data visualizations from browser history data. Ink is used for a small script that exports and transforms data for display.

### Codeliner

Codeliner generates graphics from program source files that mimic the shape of code displayed on the page.

## Language tooling

### September

September is an Ink to JavaScript compiler, written in Ink itself and tested against Ink's standard library tests. September aims to become self-hosting, but is not there yet. I wrote about [building September here](/posts/september/).

### Ink by Example

Ink by Example is a hands-on introduction to programming in Ink using annotated example programs. The website is run by [@healeycodes](https://healeycodes.com/) and [powered by Ink](https://github.com/healeycodes/inkbyexample/tree/main/src).

### dotink

This website is served by a web server written in Ink.

### inkfmt

inkfmt is a self-hosting code formatter for Ink. I wrote about [building inkfmt here](/posts/inkfmt/).

## Libraries

### ansi.ink

`ansi` is an Ink library for printing with ANSI escape sequences to a terminal emulator. It supports basic ANSI colors and cursor movements.
