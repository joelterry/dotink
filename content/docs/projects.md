## Projects

### Lucerne

![A screenshot of Lucerne displaying a timeline](/img/lucerne.png)

Lucerne is a Twitter reader and web client designed to amplify my personal Twitter workflows around learning from conversations and sharing my own writing and projects. Lucerne is built around the concept of persistent search filtered called "channels" and designed around my needs from the Twitter platform. The client is written from scratch in Ink, including the various cryptographic algorithms needed to interface with Twitter's API.

### Merlot

![Photos of Merlot running on various devices](/img/merlot-devices.png)

Merlot is a writing app for the Web that supports drafting in Markdown, and was designed to fit neatly into my blogging and writing workflow. It's built entirely and purely with Ink: the Markdown engine that runs on both the backend and the web app is written in Ink. The backend is written in Ink to run natively, and the client is written in Ink and, alongside the Markdown library, compiled down to a single-page JavaScript application.

### Sistine

Sistine is a simple, flexible, productive static site generator written entirely in Ink and built on [Merlot](#merlot)'s Markdown engine. Although it's a work in progress, Sistine is meant to eventually become a part of my primary blogging infrastructure. The documentation site is built with Sistine already, and serves as a demo.

### Traceur

Traceur is a path-tracing renderer in Ink, supporting Monte-Carlo antialiasing, realistic shadows, reflections, refractions, and focus blur.

### Klisp

![The Klisp repl](/img/klisp.png)

Klisp is a very minimal LISP written in Ink. It's primarily a pedagogical project -- I made it to understand Lisp better. Ink's semantics are already quite Lispy, so Klisp builds on Ink's semantics and adds an S-expression grammar and a repl, a true read-eval-print loop, for an ergonomic Lisp experience.

### Nightvale

Nightvale is an interactive notebook in the browser for literate programming and communicating computational ideas using prose, mathematical notation, and Klisp code. Nightvale runs entirely on Ink on the backend and on [Torus](https://github.com/thesephist/torus) on the client.

### Histools analyzer

![Histools screenshot](/img/histools.png)

Histools is a collection of tools for generating heatmaps and data visualizations from browser history data. Ink is used for a small script that exports and transforms data for display.

### Eliza

Eliza is an implementation of the classic 1960's chat bot written in isomorphic Ink, so that the same algorithm can run on the server (through the native interpreter) and the browser (through [September](/posts/september/)). This Ink version of Eliza provides a command-line chat interface and a web app powered by the same Ink algorithm.

### Matisse

Matisse is a minimalistic gallery of generative art pieces that are written in Ink. As a web app, Matisse depends on the September compiler to compile Ink programs and algorithms down to JavaScript.

### August

August is an educational assembler written from scratch in Ink, supporting 64-bit x86 ELF executables to start with more under development. It features an x86_64 instruction encoder and ELF file format library written in Ink.

## Language tooling

### September

September is an Ink to JavaScript compiler, written in Ink itself and tested against Ink's standard library tests. September aims to become self-hosting, but is not there yet.

### Ink by Example

Ink by Example is a hands-on introduction to programming in Ink using annotated example programs. The website is run by [@healeycodes](https://healeycodes.com/) and [powered by Ink](https://github.com/healeycodes/inkbyexample/tree/main/src).

### dotink

This website is served by a web server written in Ink.

### inkfmt

![inkfmt screenshot](/img/inkfmt.jpg)

inkfmt is a self-hosting code formatter for Ink used in almost every Ink project. Under the hood, inkfmt implements a tokenizer for Ink written in Ink itself.
