Building on the progress of and my positive experience with [Klisp](/posts/klisp/), I recently created [**Nightvale**](https://nightvale.dotink.co/), an interactive notebook in the browser for literate programming and communicating computational ideas using Klisp code. On Nightvale, I can create docs that combine rich (Markdown-esque) text, mathematical notation, and runnable Klisp code to explain ideas. Nightvale is written entirely in Ink on the backend, and uses my [Torus](https://github.com/thesephist/torus) UI rendering library on the client.

The name _Nightvale_ comes from the podcast _Welcome to Night Vale_, but besides the fact that the name sounded good to my ears, the two have no connection.

I think there's so much more to do in building great computational notebooks, both on top of Nightvale and elsewhere in the marketplace, and want to share some of those thoughts -- as well as how Nightvale itself works -- here.

## Literate programming notebooks

If code comments _provide_ context for source code in software, literate programming is about placing software entirely _in context_. Many times, it's valuable to think about and study software in context of a larger narrative, than simply study an implementation independently.
